This file contains basic instructions on how to compile Chronus Quantum. Chronus Quantum
depends on a number of open source packages, some of which are included in the Chronus 
Quantum source (external directory). For more details on the dependencies, including
the system and compiler dependencies, see DEPENDS.


The compilation of Chronus Quantum is handled through the CMake build. It is recommended
that Chronus Quantum be compiled out-of-source, i.e. in a build directory. On most
system, a simple CMake invocation will suffice :

  mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make

For more documentation on CMake and advanced invocations, please refer to the
CMake documentation on the CMake website.  If the compilation is successful, a
link to the "chronusq" executable will be placed in the build directory. ChronusQ
may then be invoked:

  ./chronusq <input-file>.inp

For example input files, we refer the user to the examples used for the unit tests
(the /tests directory and subdirectories therein)

Further documentation on the CMake build system is forthcoming.


It is highly recommended that that test suite be run to validate the Chronus Quantum
installation. After a successful compilation, one may run the test suite:

  make test
