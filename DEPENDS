This file contains information pertaining to the dependencies
of ChronusQ on other open-source software.



ChronusQ uses the Libint library [1] for the evaluation of 
molecular integrals over gaussian type functions. A preconfigured copy
(uncompiled) is located in the /external/libint2 directory.

ChronusQ uses the LibXC library [2] for the evaluation of 
molecular integrals over gaussian type functions. A copy of
the v3.0 is located in /external/libxc

If not using the Intel compiler suite, ChronusQ will compile a version
of OpenBLAS [3] for threaded linear algebra (defaults to MKL for the Intel
compilers). A copy of the source can be found in /external/openblas



C++11 is required for all of the dependencies. The developers
have tested with the following compilers:

 - GCC 5.3
 - GCC 6.2
 - ICC 17.0.3

Many of the external dependencies (Libint2, LibXC, OpenBLAS) are
built in the CMake build (See INSTALL). Additionally, the following system packages
must be installed:

  - HDF5 for file management
  - Boost C++ Library (Headers and Boost.Test should suffice)
  - Eigen3 for various, performance agnostic linear algebra functionality
